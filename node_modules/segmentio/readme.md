# Segment.io

[Segment.io](https://segment.io) is a segmentation-focused analytics platform. If you haven't yet,
register for a project [here](https://segment.io).

This is an official node.js client that wraps the [Segment.io REST API](https://segment.io/docs) .

You can use this driver to identify and track your visitor's events into your Segment.io project.

## Design

This client uses batching to efficiently record your events in aggregate, rather than making an HTTP
request every time. This means that it is safe to use in your web server controllers, or in back-end services
without worrying that it will make too many HTTP requests and slow down the system.

You can control the batching behavior as described below.

## How to Use

#### Install

```javascript
npm install segmentio
```
#### Create a Client

```javascript
var Segmentio = require('segmentio');
var seg = new Segmentio('YOUR_API_KEY', 'production');
```

#### Identify a Visitor

Identifying a visitor ties all of their actions to an ID you recognize and records visitor traits you can segment by.

```
seg.identify(sessionId, visitorId, traits);
```

sessionId (string) is a unique id associated with an anonymous visitor before they are logged in. If the user
is logged in, you can use null here.

visitor_id (string) is usually an email, but any unique ID will work. This is how you recognize a signed-in visitor
in your system. Note: it can be null if the visitor is not logged in.By explicitly identifying a visitor, you tie all of
their actions to their identity. This makes it possible for you to run things like segment-based email campaigns.

traits (object) is a dictionary with keys like “Subscription Plan” or “Favorite Genre”. You can segment your visitors by any trait you record. Once you record a trait, no need to send it again, so the traits argument is optional.

```javascript

seg.identify('DKGXt384hFDT82D', 'ilya@segment.io', {
    'First Name': 'Ilya',
    'Last Name': 'Volodarsky',
    'Subscription Plan': 'Premium',
    'On Mailing List': true
});

```

#### Track an Action

Whenever a visitor triggers an event on your site, you’ll want to track it so that you can analyze and segment by those events later.

```
seg.track(sessionId, visitorId, event, properties);
```

sessionId (string) is a unique id associated with an anonymous visitor before they are logged in. If the user
is logged in, you can use null here.

visitor_id (string) is usually an email, but any unique ID will work. This is how you recognize a signed-in visitor
in your system. Note: it can be null if the visitor is not logged in.By explicitly identifying a visitor, you tie all of
their actions to their identity. This makes it possible for you to run things like segment-based email campaigns.

event (string) is a human readable description like "Played a Song", "Printed a Report" or "Updated Status". You’ll be able to segment by when and how many times each event was triggered.

properties (object) is a dictionary with items that describe the event in more detail. This argument is optional, but highly recommended—you’ll find these properties extremely useful later.

```javascript

seg.track('DKGXt384hFDT82D', ilya@segment.io', 'Listened to a song', {
    'Title': 'Eleanor Rigby',
    'Artist': 'Beatles',
    'Playlist': 'Popular'
});

```

#### Adjusting Batching

You can adjust the flush triggers in the client. Take a look
